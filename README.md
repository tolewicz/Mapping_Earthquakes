# Mapping_Earthquakes
Interactive map

## Project Overview
Created interactive maps showing: city information, flight routes, districts and  earthquakes with tectonic maps. The maps have options of changing layers between street, satellite, dark and light view. The final two maps can put layers of earthquakes and tectonic plates. Each point of map when clicked shows a short information. In case of earthquakes it is the location, time and magnitude.
For various maps the source data are geoJSON files that are either downloaded or called from API through d3. Module.

## Module challenge
Created interactive map that has 4 different types of views: street, satellite, dark and light view, and possibility to set the layers of earthquakes and tectonic plates. Each earthquake is represented by a circle that when clicked shows the information data.
